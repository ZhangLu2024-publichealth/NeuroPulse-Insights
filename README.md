# EEG and AI Integration for Social Media Sentiment Analysis in Public Health Monitoring

## Overview

This project explores the integration of **Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to enhance **social media sentiment analysis** for **public health monitoring**. Traditional sentiment analysis methods rely on textual and image-based approaches, which often lack neurophysiological insights. Our approach introduces a **Cultural Semantic Alignment Network (CSAN)** combined with a **Dynamic Cultural Adaptation Strategy (DCAS)** to improve accuracy, adaptability, and contextual understanding.

## Features

- **EEG-based Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporates brainwave data to enhance sentiment decoding.
- **Cultural Semantic Alignment Network (CSAN)**: Facilitates robust cross-context sentiment interpretation.
- **Dynamic Cultural Adaptation Strategy (DCAS)**: Adapts and refines features iteratively for improved alignment.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Bridges neuroscience, AI, and public health analytics.
- **Enhanced Accuracy and Adaptability**: Outperforms conventional sentiment analysis techniques.

## Methodology

1. **EEG Data Collection**: Brainwave signals are recorded and preprocessed.
2. **Feature Encoding**: EEG features are extracted and mapped to sentiment states.
3. **CSAN Model**: Aligns sentiment representations across diverse cultural and contextual scenarios.
4. **DCAS Strategy**: Dynamically refines feature alignment for improved generalization.
5. **Social Media Sentiment Analysis**: Combines EEG-enhanced sentiment insights with textual/social data.

## Experimental Results

Our framework demonstrates superior performance in:

- **Higher sentiment classification accuracy**
- **Improved contextual adaptability**
- **Enhanced public health trend detection via social media data**

## Applications

- **Public Health Monitoring**: Detecting emotional responses to health crises and policies.
- **Mental Health Insights**: Understanding digital mental health trends.
- **Cross-Cultural Sentiment Analysis**: Adapting sentiment models across different demographics.
